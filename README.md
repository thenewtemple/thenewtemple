<b>The Jewish Publication Society (JPS)

Overview

The Tanakh is the canon of the Jewish Bible (also known as the Hebrew Bible, the Holy Scriptures,
or the Old Testament). “Tanakh” is an acronym for the text’s three sections: the Torah (the Five
Books of Moses), Nevi’im (Prophets) and Ketuvim (Writings).

The JPS Tanakh is widely recognized as the most authoritative and preferred English translation
of the Hebrew Bible in the Jewish world and beyond.
  
Editions
  
The JPS Tanakh is available in print in various sizes, colors, and styles in both a Hebrew-English
edition and an English-only edition. !e English-only version is also available through most
e-book vendors. Print editions of portions of the Tanakh are also available, such as %e Torah, %e
Book of Psalms, and %e Five Megilloth and Jonah. !e JPS Audio Bible is an audio version of the
English-only edition available through audible.com and iTunes.com.
  
About the Translation
  
Regarded throughout the English-speaking world as a landmark English translation of the Holy
Scriptures, the JPS Tanakh has been acclaimed by scholars, rabbis, lay leaders and Jews alike. 
The JPS Tanakh is an entirely original translation of the Holy Scriptures into contemporary English, 
based on the original masoretic (traditional Hebrew) text. The JPS tanakh
emerged from the collaborative efforts of an interdenominational team of Jewish scholars and
rabbis working together over a twenty-year period. The translators made use of the entire range of
biblical interpretation, ancient and modern, Jewish and non-Jewish. !e resulting text is a triumph
of literary style and biblical scholarship, unsurpassed in accuracy and clarity. 
  
About the Hebrew Text
  
Thee Hebrew text of the JPS Tanakh is based on the famed Leningrad Codex, the masoretic text
traceable to Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, ca. 930. Ben Asher researched all available texts to compile an authoritative Bible manuscript. 
In 1010 his work was revised by Samuel ben Jacob, a scribe in Egypt. Lost for centuries, 
the manuscript was eventually discovered in the mid-nineteenth century and became known as the Leningrad Codex. 
JPS has adapted the latest BHS edition of the Leningrad text by correcting errors and providing modern paragraphing.
